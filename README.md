# P003-Library_Management_System-SQL-

# Description:

  Project Objectives:
    
    This project demonstrates the implementation of the “Library Management System using MySQL server.” 
    It includes creating and managing tables, performing crud operations and executing intermediate SQL queries. 
    Exercise and practice skills in database design, manipulation and querying. 
    Transform data into meaningful and actionable insights to help library management team,
      to improve performance and overall management service.
  
# Approach:
    
    In this project, I am using MySQL Workbench as tool,
    to analyse Library management data and answer questions posed by the management team. 
    •	Here, I use SQL queries to extract the required information from the database, 
    also ensuring the accuracy and efficiency of the queries & the result-data solutions.
    •	The Final insights will help the product manager and the rest of the team to make informed decisions,
    about the future direction of the Library Management System & service improvement.
    
  Approach used to complete this Project:

  1)	CRUD operation:
    
    -I perform different CRUD operations on database as per project task requirement. 
    -Here, I get hand on experience about different SQL commands, 
      which help to manage and manipulate data as per task requirement. 
    -This will help me to maintain the Library Management System updated.

  2)	Data Analysis and Insights: 
    
    -I perform analysis operations on the data from given database and solve given task by the management team. 
    -Here, I get a hand on experience to transform data into meaningful & actionable insights,
      to help team to improve performance of library management and services deliver to customers.
